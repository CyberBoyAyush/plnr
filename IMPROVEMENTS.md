- Emphasis on actionable, specific output

### 4. 📊 Step-by-Step Workflow

Each phase is clearly labeled:
1. **🔍 Analyzing Codebase** - Scanning and detecting
2. **📄 Reading Files** - Loading source code
3. **🤖 Generating Plan** - AI processing
4. **📤 Exporting** - Saving results

### 5. 🎨 Improved Color Scheme

- **Cyan**: Headers and important info
- **Blue**: Progress steps
- **Green**: Success messages
- **Gray**: Secondary/debug info
- **Yellow**: Warnings
